# Book Changelog {.unnumbered}

This Machine Learning Systems textbook originated from lecture materials developed for CS249r at Harvard University. Through valuable feedback from students, professors, practitioners, researchers, and learners such as yourself, it continues to evolve and improve. While the content is useful in its current form, the book remains under active development---with ongoing effort to expand the technical coverage, refine explanations, and incorporate updates informed by academic and industry expertise.
